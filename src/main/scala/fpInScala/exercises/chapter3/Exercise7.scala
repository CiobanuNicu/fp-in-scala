  // Can product, implemented using foldRight, immediately halt the recursion and return 0.0 if it encounters a 0.0?
  // Why or why not? Consider how any short-circuiting might work if you call foldRight with a large list.
  // This is a deeper question that we'll return to in chapter 5.

  // No, it's not possible given the current implementation of foldRight.
